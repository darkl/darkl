### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Elad. I used to be a full time C# developer at an enterprise company in Israel. I'm mostly interested in software infrastructure, which includes: network protocols, serialization protocols, multi-threading frameworks, code generation (runtime/design time), etc.

I'm currently a Donald J. Lewis Postdoctoral Research Assistant Professor at [the department of Mathematics in the University of Michigan]([https://math.yale.edu/](https://lsa.umich.edu/math)), working in [automorphic forms](https://people.math.osu.edu/cogdell.1/fields-www.pdf). You can find some of my work [here](https://elad.zelingher.com/papers/). I still try to contribute in my free time to the open-source community, mostly to projects related to the [Web Application Messaging Protocol](https://wamp-proto.org/) ecosystem. Among my contributions you can find [WampSharp](https://wampsharp.net/), [autobahn type definitions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/autobahn/), and [Firefox WebSocket inspector support for WAMP messages](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/02/firefox-73-is-upon-us/).

I used to write tips in Hebrew about programming in .NET/C# on a daily basis, you can find these [here](https://elad.zelingher.com/tips). Feel free to contact me at *firstname*@codesharp.net, but please note that I'm currently not looking for a job.
